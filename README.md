# BST 
The program begins by generating a binary search tree with user-specified size, where integers are inserted as nodes in a manner that maintains the BST properties: values less than a parent node are placed in the left subtree, and values greater or equal are placed in the right subtree.
Additionally, the program undertakes a performance analysis comparing the sorting capabilities of the BST in-order traversal method against the traditional bubble sort algorithm. For this analysis, datasets of varying sizes (from 1000 to 10000 elements) are used to observe how each sorting method scales with increasing data size. The results, including the time taken for each sort method, are presented, offering insights into the efficiency of tree-based sorting compared to elementary sorting algorithms.
